Collection of data in the year 2017 by the metro (S-Bahn) in Stuttgart, e.g., arrival times, planned arrival times etc.

Note: As the downloaded file (http://download-data.deutschebahn.com/static/datasets/sbahn_stuttgart/20170901-20171019_Alle_Istmeldungen_S-Bahn_Stuttgart.csv) is too large to push here, the script downloads it itself when run or uses it if it is next to the script.

# Code
Small python script to fetch average times a train is at a station, standard deviation,etc.
